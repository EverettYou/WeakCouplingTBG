# WeakCouplingTBG
Data generated during and/or analyzed during the study of "Superconductivity from Valley Fluctuations and Approximate SO(4) Symmetry in a Weak Coupling Theory of Twisted Bilayer Graphene" are available in this repository.

Mathematica notebook [bilayer.nb](/bilayer.nb) contains all calculation details. The phase diagram data is stored under /data. The RPA calculation is done with Fortran code with data stored under /Fortran.
